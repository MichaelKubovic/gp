<h2>Tourism in Bulgaria</h2>
Tourism in Bulgaria is a significant contributor to the country's economy. In 2008 Bulgaria was visited by 8.9 million tourists, as outlined by the World Tourism Organization. Tourists from three countries - Greece, Romania and Turkey - account for 40% of visitors. New types of tourism, including cultural, architectural and historic tours, eco-tourism, and adventure tours, are expanding the range of visitor experiences.
Sea tourism in Bulgaria has been growing since the 1960s. Under Communist rule, a handful of luxury resorts - Albena, Golden Sands and Sunny Beach - were a gathering point for the Eastern Bloc elite. The local Black Sea coast was sometimes called "the Red Riviera" as it had no dangerous wildlife, a long summer season and a very warm climate. The number of tourists visiting Bulgaria's coastline from both East and West steadily increased throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Tourism became a strategic sector in the economy, and it holds this position to a certain degree today. The number of tourists has been growing rapidly in recent years; in 2010, Bulgaria was the most popular tourist destination for British citizens.

An increasing number of foreigners and Bulgarians alike are engaging in what has been described as "alcohol tourism" in the numerous resorts along the country's Southern Black Sea coast. Tourists are flocking to some of the country's top coastal resorts indulging in "cheap alcohol and nightclubs offering a sex service to willing foreigners".
Scores of restaurants, discos, and hotels in the southern resorts, including Bulgaria's largest resort Sunny Beach, are offering cheap alcohol and cocktails which are attractive to both foreign and Bulgarian tourists.
