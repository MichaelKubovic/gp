SUNNY BEACH

“Sunny Beach” is a major seaside resort on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, located approximately 35 km north of Burgas.
It is the largest and most popular holiday resort in Bulgaria, and is home to over 200 hotels with more than 300,000 beds. 
Sunny Beach has a very small permanent population, but during the summer the resort is home to many thousands of tourists. The main strip of high-rise hotels backing onto the beach is several kilometres long and extends along a wide bay between Sveti Vlas and Nessebar.
There are 130 restaurants and numerous live music bars, pubs, nightclubs, discos and cafes. It has been undergoing continuous expansion for many years. In recent years almost the whole hotel base has been renovated and several new luxurious hotels have been built as well as many apartment complexes.
Attractions for tourists include the sunning at the beach, water sports and the nearby historical site of Nessebar. There are two new aqua parks near the resort. Sunny Beach is mainly popular amongst young people for its nightlife.
