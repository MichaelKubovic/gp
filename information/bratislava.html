<h2>Bratislava - The Slovak Capital</h2>
<p>The most popular and the most frequently visited city in the south-west of Slovakia is Bratislava, which belongs to the youngest european metropolis. You can find many architectonic monuments from different time periods here. The most dominant and the symbol of Bratislava's rich history is Bratislava castle. From its courtyard you will have a beautiful view not only on historical part of this city, but also on the neighbouring Austria and Hungary. There is an exposition of historical and music museum to be looked at and in the treasure-house you will find exceptionally eminent historical artefact known as Moravianska Venus. On your visit to Bratislava you should not miss visiting Devín castle as well, which is located on the two famous rivers – The Danube and the Marova. You can admire the view on the neighbouring Austria from its tower. You may also find a tablet from historical trip of the Slovak youth to Devín, which was organized by Ľudovít Štúr. Both castles are an ideal place for taking a walk with breathtaking views.</p>

<h3>Bratislava Castle</h3>
<p>The castle, on a hill above the old town, dominates the city of Bratislava. It features in the first written reference to the city, which appears in the Annals of Salzburg of 907, in association with a battle between Bavarians and Hungarians. The castle hill was populated as early as the late Stone Age; its first known inhabitants were the Celts, who founded a fortified settlement here called ‘Oppidum’.</p>

<h3>UFO</h3>
<p>Stylish restaurant at the top of Novy Most (New Bridge). The restaurant has a delicious two-page menu including a seven course dinner from € 75 and a three course lunch from € 30. Restaurant open daily noon to 11 p.m. Once a month a big party is held at UFO, guests are admitted by invitation only.</p>

<p>85 meters above the ground there is a bar and 95 meters up, there is a sightseeing deck as well. The deck was not accessible to people during communism in order to prevent people from seeing capitalist Austria.<p>

<p>The bridge itself was voted the construction of the 20th century in Slovakia.</p>

<h3>Shopping Districts</h3>

<p>Shopping outlets in Bratislava tend to be divided between larger stores in out-of-town centres and smaller shops in and around the city centre.
With the limited exception of the Tesco store in Kamenné Square, on the edge of the old town, the centre of Bratislava has no large 'department' stores. Instead, the centre is dotted with shops selling designer clothing, jewellery, books and souvenirs, in between cafes, pubs and restaurants. The principal shopping street in the centre is Obchodná.</p>
 
<p>The mall-style shopping centres around Bratislava have extensive car parking and a wide range of international brand-name shops.  The mains ones are: Eurovea Galleria, within walking distance of the old town, on the Danube embankment; Aupark, south of the Danube River but within walking distance or a short bus ride of the city centre; Avion, near the city ring road and the airport; Polus City Center on Vajnorská, one of the main roads leading north out of the city; and Shopping Palace Zlaté Piesky, on the northern edge of town.  The last two are both accessible by tram from the city centre. Clustered around the Avion centre are several large furniture and design stores, including an IKEA.</p>
