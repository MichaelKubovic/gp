Epiphany

In Bulgaria, Epiphany is celebrated on January 6th and is known as Bogoyavlenie ("Manifestation of God"), or Yordanovden ("Day of Jordan", referring to the river). On this day, a wooden cross is thrown by a priest into the sea, river or lake and young men race to retrieve it. As the date is in early January and the waters are close to freezing, this is considered an honorable act and it is said that good health will be bestowed upon the home of the swimmer who is the first to reach the cross.
In the town of Kalofer, a traditional "horo" with drums and bagpipes is played in the icy waters of the Tundzha river before the throwing of the cross. Groups of young men gather and drink red wine the night before, so they don't feel the cold the next day.
