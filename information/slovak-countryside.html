<h2>Countryside</h2>
<p>Come and camp in a fully equiped canvas tent on our farm in sunny southern Slovakia.

We have a gorgeous piece of land in the heart of Europe, where you can come and stay in one of our canvas bell or 'de Waard' tents. At Farm and Camp Site 'Lazy' we aim to offer our guests a real escape from their everyday lives.

We have a small farm, and grow as much of our own fruit and vegetables as possible. We also keep dairy sheep and goats for lovely milk, yoghurt and cheeses, some chickens to provide us with fresh eggs and two free range Mangalizta pigs for great sausages and hams. We would like to share this produce with you during your stay.

We want to provide a great place to stay with minimum impact on the environment. But donâ€™t let this frighten you! You are able to charge laptops and mobile phones if you wish. We even have (slow) internet access if you wish to stay connected once in a while ;)
