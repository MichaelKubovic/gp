<h2>From Czechoslovakia to European Union</h2>
<h3>The Federation of Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>In 1867 the Habsburg domains in central Europe were reconstituted as the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. During World War I (1914-1918) Czechs, Slovaks, and other national groups of Austria-Hungary were joined by Czechs and Slovaks living abroad in campaigning for an independent state. In October 1918, at the end of the war, Slovakia announced its independence from the empire and incorporation into the new republic of Czechoslovakia. The new republic included the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, a small part of Silesia, and Slovakia; within these boundaries were areas inhabited by hundreds of thousands of Hungarians. A parliamentary democratic government was formed, and a capital was established in the Czech city of Prague.</p>

<p>Slovaks, who were greatly outnumbered by the Czechs, differed in many important ways from their Czech neighbors. The Slovak economy was more agrarian endless developed than its Czech counterpart; the majority of Slovaks were practicing Catholics while the Czech leadership believed in limiting the power of the church, and the Slovak people had generally less education and experience with self-government than the Czechs. These disparities, compounded by centralized governmental control from Prague, produced discontent among Slovaks with the structure of the new state.</p>

<p>In the period between the two world wars, the Czechoslovak government attempted to industrialize Slovakia. These efforts were not successful, however, due in part to the Great Depression, the worldwide economic slump of the 1930s. Slovak resentment over what was perceived to be economic and political domination by the Czechs led to increasing dissatisfaction with the federation and growing support for extreme nationalist movements. Father Andrej Hlinka and his infamous successor, Father Jozef Tiso, were joined by many Slovaks in calls for equality between Czechs and Slovaks and greater autonomy for Slovakia.</p>

<h3>The Breakup of Czechoslovakia</h3>

<p>The results of the elections of June 1992 reflected the growing split between the two lands. The liberal Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), led by Slovak Vladmir Meciar, and the conservative Civic Democratic Party, led by Czech Vaclav Klaus won the two largest representations in parliament; each leader became the prime minister of his own republic. Disagreements between the republics intensified, and it became clear that no form offederal government could satisfy both. In July 1992 Slovakia declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government.</p>

<p>Throughout the fall of that year, Meciar and Klaus negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on December 31, despite polls indicating that the majority of citizens opposed the split. In January 1993 Czechoslovakia was replaced by two independent states: Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Slovaks gathered for celebrations in their new nation's capital at Bratislava.</p>

<h3>Joining the EU</h3>

<p>Relations between Slovak Republic and European Union (Slovakia & EU) are based on the European Association Agreement, which was signed on 4th of October 1993 and came into force on 1st of February 1995. Slovakia, with other associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, was involved in the process of EU enlargement. In 1995, these countries applied to become members of the EU: Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria. Czech Republic and Slovenia have applied to join the EU in June 1996.</p>

<p>Joining the European Union belonged to the priorities of Slovak foreign policy since the Slovak Republic was established as an independent country in 1993. Vladimír Mečiar, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, committed the application for the Slovak Republic into the EU on 27th of June 1995 at the European Council meeting in Cannes.</p>
