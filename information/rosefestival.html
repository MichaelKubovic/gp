<h2>Rose Festival</h2>
The Valley of Roses is majestic! It is the is the home of the exquisite and rare Bulgarian rose oil, also known as "attar of roses", a well renowned world center for rose oil production and the source of many of the world's finest perfumes. May and June are the most majestic months in the Rose Valley, as the rose fields are blossoming and the entire valley is enveloped with their fragrance. It is unique and rare experience to spend a night or two at Kazanlak in May or June- to breath, to immerse in the rose fragrance. 
The Rose Valley is situated between the Balkan and Sredna Gora mountains.In the 19th century Rosa Damascena became the greatest wealth of the Kazanlak region. Today Rosa Damascenan is a symbol of Bulgaria. This year we celebrate 110 years anniversary of the rose festival at Kazanlak.
